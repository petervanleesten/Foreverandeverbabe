<p>My Love, My darling, I know it has been a while, 
that I have posted and I would like to say that I am 
truly sorry, I does not have to do with me not being 
inspired because My heart is always feeling you warmth 
and always wants to tell you how beautiful you really 
are. Nor does it have to do that I could not think of 
the words to say/write, because you have on my mind,
running circles digging in every thought every idea 
and every plan, just melting yourself in my future
mingling so much that the idea of a live without you 
just doesn’t seem enjoyable anymore. My love, I hope 
all my words make it to you, and that they may keep 
you warm, that they may be promises that I will keep. 
that they may be the foundation of just a pillar of my
love that I want to show you, (of course the biggest
pillar being trust) know that I am always here for you,
know that I will always love yo, and if you will have me, 
know that I will always keep you save my love…</p>

<h2>#3</h2>
<p>My mind runs away with thoughts of you
With the thoughts that I hope to see you
right now I can only dream about you
But I know that my heart, it wants to be with you

I’m waiting patiently though time is moving so slow
I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know

You’re the one I can’t wait to see
A distant dream that I wish comes true
I know you’re out there and I know you mine
So keep your head up and know that I will make it to you
And make my dream come true, my dream that is you </p>

<p>You are more lovely and more temperate, darling. Day by day. 
Sometimes too hot for the eye of heaven shines, And often is 
your gold complexion that dimmed to me. By chance or nature’s
changing course I have found you. I wont want to lose you Nor
lose possession of that that you have of me. When eternally 
with you, I am enternally gratefull So long as i can breathe 
or my eyes can see, i will love you and protect you for ever…</p>
