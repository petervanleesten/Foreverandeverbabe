<p>I crave your lips so bad, your voice, your long hair.
Silent and starving, I long for you.
My thoughts do not nourish me anymore, for it is disrupted 
by your charms that I want, and your touch I need, all day
 and all night. Sleepless I say awake thinking about you.

I hunger for your sleek laugh, and you warmth of your heart.
your hands in mine, I hunger for your smile, that would open
a way straight to my melted heart, I want to feel your skin
on mine.

I want to kiss the naked flesh of your lovely body,
the sovereign stare of your beautifull lips,
I want to smell the tast of your hair that will be entangled
between us, while I move around you feeling the lush of your 
lust the sweat of your heat and the hungry of your mind.

All in all,  I can't wait to love you and make love to you.
For your heart, will be mine and mine will be yours.
For all I want will be you, and all I can give, will be me.

Meaning a state of mind or body. So all together, Means that I ow you without any

And without a doubth that is what I plan to give to you. Because that is what you

<p>	I can not compare you to the best thing that ever happend to me,
	Because you are the best thing that ever happend to me.
	and you are still more lovely and more temptatius to my eyes then ever before,
	Darling you make me want you, to the breaking point, where I can
	not even disire anything els or desire thinking straight without the sexual thought of you.
	I dream of night’s with you and all your beauty in a too short white dress.
	Holding you and squeesing you in my arms and cuddle you.
	Sometimes you look too amazing for my eye's, and we stray ofcourse from cuddleling,
	And often is just your eyes I dream about. Every dream seemed far from reality,
	but sometimes if feels so real and so perfect that I never wanted to wake up.
	
	I do not want to wake up if it is not you that is by my side.
	But for now, all I can do is dream about you. And all I do is wait,
	Untill you are eternally in my life when I wake up. right next to me.
	Then the dream doesn't stop because I opend my eyes.
	
	When my "what feels like a eternal wait" will be over.
	Then I can squeezy you for real as long as I can breathe or eyes can stay open,
   	and I can live long besides you. So that that will be the new best thing that
	ever happend to me, Holding you, opening my eyes and seeing my dream come true.

<p>Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been.

And you can't help who you fall inlove with.
You find yourself giving it all away
to that one person...

And it can't be helped, because	
you wanna be the one who they believe,
loves them as much as they love you.
But You don't have to ever say you love me
You don not have to say anything back
You don not even have tell anyone that you're mine
	
So just let me Just Love you...	</p>

<p>It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you,
Because	You don't love someone you can live with, 
you love the person you cannot live without.
Love is passion, obsession, someone you can’t live without.
And What I really want to do with my life, what I want to do for a living
is, I want to be with you. Making you happy. In my opinion, 
the best thing you can do is find someone who loves you for exactly
what you are. And I freaking Love you, all of you, just the way you are!

I am here and I am looking at you. And you are so beautiful. 
I can see it and everything that makes you wonderfull.
And I’ve come here with no expectations, 
only to profess, now that I am at liberty to do so,
that my heart is, and always will be, yours foreverandever...

<p>No, I like you very much. Just as you are and
I think I'd miss you even if we'd never met.
You have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love… I love… I love you.	
I love you without knowing how, why, or even from where.
It was a million tiny little things that, when you added them all up, 
they meant we were supposed to be together … and I knew it. 
I knew it the very first time I almost touched you. 
It was like coming home. .. only to no home I’d ever known … 
I wanted just to take your hand to help you cross the street
and I knew. It was like … magic. I was never letting you go.	
You were the only thing in my life that felt that real. 
They say when you meet the love of your life, 
time stops, and that’s true.	
The greatest thing you’ll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.

<p>The only way you can beat my crazy was by doing something crazy yourself. 
Thank you. I love you. I knew when I got to know you more and more. 
I’m sorry it took so long for me to catch up. I just got stuck on you.
It doesn’t matter if you are perfect or that I am perfect, all that matters
is as long as we are perfect for each other, and I feel that we are.
You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how.	
I hope you see that, Every step I take, since I fell inlove with you, 
is to bring me closer to you. I hope all those steps bring me to you.
You make me want to be a better man and I vow to fiercely love you
in all your forms, now and forever. I promise to never forget that 
this is a once in a lifetime love. I’ll Never Let Go, Love. I Promise.

<p>“I’ve fallen in love. I’m an ordinary man.
I didn’t think such violent things could happen
to ordinary people,I knew I’d never be able to remember 
what you wore that day. But I also knew I’d never 
forget the way you looked, I want it to be you, 
I want it to be you so badly, I want you.
I want all of you, forever, you and me, every day.
I can't see anything I don't like about you.
I could die right now, I'm just... happy. 
I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where 
and with who I want to be, To me, you are perfect.
I love you. You complete me, I wish I had done everything
on earth with you. I guess when you’re young, you just
believe there’ll be many people…you’ll connect with.
Later in life, you realize it only happens just onces. 
I will find you. Love you. Marry you. And live with you 
forever”</p>

<p>My Love, My darling, I know it has been a while, 
that I have posted and I would like to say that I am 
truly sorry, I does not have to do with me not being 
inspired because My heart is always feeling you warmth 
and always wants to tell you how beautiful you really 
are. Nor does it have to do that I could not think of 
the words to say/write, because you have on my mind,
running circles digging in every thought every idea 
and every plan, just melting yourself in my future
mingling so much that the idea of a live without you 
just doesn’t seem enjoyable anymore. My love, I hope 
all my words make it to you, and that they may keep 
you warm, that they may be promises that I will keep. 
that they may be the foundation of just a pillar of my
love that I want to show you, (of course the biggest
pillar being trust) know that I am always here for you,
know that I will always love yo, and if you will have me, 
know that I will always keep you save my love…</p>

<p>My mind runs away with thoughts of you
With the thoughts that I hope to see you
right now I can only dream about you
But I know that my heart, it wants to be with you

I’m waiting patiently though time is moving so slow
I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know

You’re the one I can’t wait to see
A distant dream that I wish comes true
I know you’re out there and I know you mine
So keep your head up and know that I will make it to you
And make my dream come true, my dream that is you </p>

Sometimes too hot for the eye of heaven shines, And often is

changing course I have found you. I wont want to lose you Nor
lose possession of that that you have of me. When eternally 
with you, I am enternally gratefull So long as i can breathe
