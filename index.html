<p>I'd walk through fire for you and	
I'm thinkin' 'bout you all day long
From your lips, your eyes to
my hands on your hips
I'm fantasizin' 'bout what I'm gon' do to you..

<h2>#11</h2>
<p>Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been.
But when love won't let you choice
And you can't help who you fall inlove with.
You find yourself giving it all away
to that one person...

And it can't be helped, because	
you wanna be the one who they believe,
loves them as much as they love you.
But You don't have to ever say you love me
You don not have to say anything back
You don not even have tell anyone that you're mine
	
So just let me Just Love you...	</p>

<p>It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you,
Because	You don't love someone you can live with, 
you love the person you cannot live without.
Love is passion, obsession, someone you can’t live without.
And What I really want to do with my life, what I want to do for a living
is, I want to be with you. Making you happy. In my opinion, 
the best thing you can do is find someone who loves you for exactly
what you are. And I freaking Love you, all of you, just the way you are!

I am here and I am looking at you. And you are so beautiful. 
I can see it and everything that makes you wonderfull.
And I’ve come here with no expectations, 
only to profess, now that I am at liberty to do so,
that my heart is, and always will be, yours foreverandever...

<p>No, I like you very much. Just as you are and
I think I'd miss you even if we'd never met.
You have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love… I love… I love you.	
I love you without knowing how, why, or even from where.
It was a million tiny little things that, when you added them all up, 
they meant we were supposed to be together … and I knew it. 
I knew it the very first time I almost touched you. 
It was like coming home. .. only to no home I’d ever known … 
I wanted just to take your hand to help you cross the street
and I knew. It was like … magic. I was never letting you go.	
You were the only thing in my life that felt that real. 
They say when you meet the love of your life, 
time stops, and that’s true.	
The greatest thing you’ll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.

<p>The only way you can beat my crazy was by doing something crazy yourself. 
Thank you. I love you. I knew when I got to know you more and more. 
I’m sorry it took so long for me to catch up. I just got stuck on you.
It doesn’t matter if you are perfect or that I am perfect, all that matters
is as long as we are perfect for each other, and I feel that we are.
You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how.	
I hope you see that, Every step I take, since I fell inlove with you, 
is to bring me closer to you. I hope all those steps bring me to you.
You make me want to be a better man and I vow to fiercely love you
in all your forms, now and forever. I promise to never forget that 
this is a once in a lifetime love. I’ll Never Let Go, Love. I Promise.

<p>“I’ve fallen in love. I’m an ordinary man.
I didn’t think such violent things could happen
to ordinary people,I knew I’d never be able to remember 
what you wore that day. But I also knew I’d never 
forget the way you looked, I want it to be you, 
I want it to be you so badly, I want you.
I want all of you, forever, you and me, every day.
I can't see anything I don't like about you.
I could die right now, I'm just... happy. 
I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where 
and with who I want to be, To me, you are perfect.
I love you. You complete me, I wish I had done everything
on earth with you. I guess when you’re young, you just
believe there’ll be many people…you’ll connect with.
Later in life, you realize it only happens just onces. 
I will find you. Love you. Marry you. And live with you 
forever”</p>

<p>You, fill my heart up, When the rest of it was gone,
You, have enchaned me, even tho you were not around,
I Feel so enamored by the hold of clutch,
I am so encaptured by your touch,
I am latching on to you, Now and forever because, 
I know what I have found
I wanna hold you so much...
When you get in my arms, I won't let go of you...
Until my heart gives out his last heart beat out of my chest.

<p>My Love, My darling, I know it has been a while, 
that I have posted and I would like to say that I am 
truly sorry, I does not have to do with me not being 
inspired because My heart is always feeling you warmth 
and always wants to tell you how beautiful you really 
are. Nor does it have to do that I could not think of 
the words to say/write, because you have on my mind,
running circles digging in every thought every idea 
and every plan, just melting yourself in my future
mingling so much that the idea of a live without you 
just doesn’t seem enjoyable anymore. My love, I hope 
all my words make it to you, and that they may keep 
you warm, that they may be promises that I will keep. 
that they may be the foundation of just a pillar of my
love that I want to show you, (of course the biggest
pillar being trust) know that I am always here for you,
know that I will always love yo, and if you will have me, 
know that I will always keep you save my love…</p>

<h2>#3</h2>
<p>My mind runs away with thoughts of you
With the thoughts that I hope to see you
right now I can only dream about you
But I know that my heart, it wants to be with you

I’m waiting patiently though time is moving so slow
I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know

You’re the one I can’t wait to see
A distant dream that I wish comes true
I know you’re out there and I know you mine
So keep your head up and know that I will make it to you
And make my dream come true, my dream that is you </p>

<p>You are more lovely and more temperate, darling. Day by day. 
Sometimes too hot for the eye of heaven shines, And often is 
your gold complexion that dimmed to me. By chance or nature’s
changing course I have found you. I wont want to lose you Nor
lose possession of that that you have of me. When eternally 
with you, I am enternally gratefull So long as i can breathe 
or my eyes can see, i will love you and protect you for ever…</p>
